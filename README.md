## What This Project Does

This research introduces a **progressive fine-tuning methodology** for automatically diagnosing kidney diseases from CT scans. 
Unlike conventional fine-tuning, this pipeline incrementally unlocks model capacity, then applies **class-weight balancing by Bayesian optimization** to address dataset imbalance before performing ensemble-style Test-Time Augmentation.

### The Problem We Solved
- Manual kidney disease diagnosis is time-consuming and subjective
- Traditional AI models struggle with medical imaging nuances
- Existing approaches often fail to achieve clinical-grade accuracy
- Need for automated, reliable diagnostic assistance

### Our Innovation
- **Progressive Fine-Tuning Pipeline:** Feature extraction ‚Üí selective fine-tuning ‚Üí ultra fine-tuning ‚Üí class-weight optimized ultra refinement
- **Class Imbalance Mitigation:** Automated computation + Bayesian search of weighting space
- **Medical-Optimized Preprocessing:** Custom HU windowing + CLAHE enhancement
- **TestTime Augmentation:** 5-strategy ensemble for maximum accuracy
- **CPU-Friendly Implementation:** Accessible without expensive GPU hardware

## Technical Innovation

### Progressive Fine-Tuning Pipeline
```
Step 1: Feature Extraction
  - Freeze all DenseNet201 layers
  - Train only classification head
  - Establish domain alignment

Step 2: Selective Fine-tuning
  - Unfreeze last 30 layers
  - LR = 1e-5 (conservative)
  - Refine high-level discriminative blocks

Step 3: Ultra Fine-tuning
  - Unfreeze last 50 layers
  - LR = 5e-6 (ultra conservative)
  - Deep adaptation to medical texture statistics

Class-Weight Balacing By Bayesian Optimization
  - Compute per-class weights (inverse frequency / smoothed)
  - Bayesian search over weight scaling
  - Short controlled refinement (few epochs)
  - Stabilize minority-class sensitivity

Inference Enhancement: Test-Time Augmentation (5-policy ensemble averaging)
```

### Medical Image Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **HU Windowing:** Optimize for kidney tissue contrast
2. **CLAHE Enhancement:** Adaptive histogram equalization
3. **Normalization:** Stable neural network input
4. **Augmentation:** Medical-imaging appropriate transforms

### Test-Time Augmentation Strategy
- Base prediction (no augmentation)
- Horizontal flip variations
- Small rotation adjustments  
- Zoom perturbations
- Position shifts
- **Ensemble averaging** for final prediction
